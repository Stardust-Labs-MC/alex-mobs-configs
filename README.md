# Stardust BiomeTweaker Configs

Many mods - like Alex's Mobs - require the Forge Biome Dictionary to work. Terralith, Incendium, and etc, being datapacks, cannot use the Forge biome dictionary by default. Therefore, one can use the [BiomeTweaker](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/biometweaker) mod and a few config files in order to allow better compatibility wit hthings like Alex's Mobs.

## Installation

- Install [BiomeTweaker](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/biometweaker)
- Run the game once in order ot generate the configs
- Download the config files from this repository by clicking on the [Releases](https://github.com/Stardust-Labs-MC/alex-mobs-configs/releases/tag/Downloads) button
- Paste those config files in the `config/biometweaker/scripts` folder
- Restart your game
